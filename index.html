          <p>Mission Hill is a community marked by diversity &mdash; in ethnicity, age, vocation, and more. Although politically and geographically bounded in concrete terms, demographically it is a community that resists those conventional boundaries. To understand Mission Hill is not to conceptualize it by its cartographic borders but rather to imagine it as a kaleidoscopic tapestry of people and places spread out across complex layers of demographic space and generational time.</p>

          <p>The Mission Hill community is composed of individuals of many ages, from people in their teens to those in their eighties. These residents have called Mission Hill their home for various durations &mdash; some for just a few years, and others for a lifetime.

          <p>Half of those profiled in Mission Hill 100 have lived in Mission Hill for more than a decade.</p>

          <p>Like much of the greater Boston area, living in Mission Hill is expensive. As the cost of living and rent prices continue to climb upwards, many residents are increasingly pushed out of the place they have called home for many years. This graph shows median rent prices for homes in Mission Hill. Even a 1-bedroom apartment costs nearly $2000 each month.</p>
